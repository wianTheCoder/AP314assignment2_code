If you decide you want to test this code youself and see the output simply do the following:

For question 1b
  comment question2() out on line 20 by putting // in front. Then removing the // in front of question1b().
  Then go to line 205 and 206, and change the primes.
  If you want to choose a custom modulus simply delete the 'prime1*prime2' and enter your own number.
  To choose a different encrypting exponent, go to line 220 and enter it there.
  To change the message go to line 237, also change the size of the array to the size of the message spaces included, or the program will not work or crash.
  
For question 2
